# Deskpods

I subscribe to a lot of podcasts and Spotify is my podcast feed of choice. One nuisance about the desktop app is that you cannot view your latest podcasts by episode in the desktop application like you can on the mobile. Maybe I'm the only person that's bothered by this, but nonetheless it bothers me haha.

## Viewing Pods on each device

I can only view by show..... c'mon Spotify

## What Deskpods does

For now all deskpods does is add a playlist to your Spotify profile with your latest podcasts.

Initially I wanted the user to be able to play podcasts directly in the browser, but currently Spotify's API does not allow you to pass in an individual episodes URI, and if you pass in a show's URI, it will play the first episode of that show.

## Work in Progress

Like all projects, Deskpods is not complete, however for now it has the functionality I intended it to have and am continuously working on it. If you have any suggestions or issues, feel free to [reach out!](mailto:atang8013@gmail.com?subject=Some%20thoughts%20on%20Deskpods)
